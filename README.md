# React Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website project built with React and TailwindCSS.

Since this is my first project in React, I have mainly focused on building components and using props.  
Most of the UI interactivity is using standard JS since I drafted the project in vanilla JS beforehand.  
In this project I learned a lot about refactoring of code into components and passing props around.  
In addition, I reinforced my knowledge of TailwindCSS and design principles, as well as the use of the third party library implementation, here, tsParticles.
